title: "Site refresh: Minimal Mistakes theme"

Just a quick post in case anyone is discombobulated by the changes in the website...

I've decided to switch to Michael Rose's [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/about/). It's a fantastic layout and fully supports all the features I need.

Yes, this means I've given up on using my own *from-scratch* CSS and designs. Here's what it looked like most recently before the switch:
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2020_site.png" alt="Screenshot of the old site from 2020." caption="Definitely more unique than an off-the-shelf theme, but not so pretty" %}

I definitely think it's an improvement!

As before, comments on blog posts are enabled through GitHub issues, but this time I've become aware of [Utterances](https://utteranc.es), an awesome little widget that takes care of setting this up.
