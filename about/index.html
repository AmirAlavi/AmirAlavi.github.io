	<h1>Hi there, I'm Amir Alavi!</h1>
	<div class="reading-font">
		I am currently Ph.D. student in Computational Biology at the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University.
		<br>
		<br>
		My advisor is <a href="http://sb.cs.cmu.edu/">Dr. Ziv Bar-Joseph</a>, and my research areas span machine learning and genomics. In particular, I work on dimensionality reduction techniques (such as neural network embeddings) for single-cell RNA-sequencing data.

	<div class="reading-font">
		Often times, the collection of data across the web is done without thought, and believed to be harmless. Many organizations (companies, individuals, governments, etc) will collect data about their users' activity. Usually the user is unaware, and has no reasonable way to prevent this. 

		Even analytics, a seemingly innocent purpose, can collect enough data to cause concern. 

		Thus, I have removed Google Analytics from my website.
