			<h1>Privacy</h1>
			<div class="reading-font">
				Often times, the collection of data across the web is done without thought, and believed to be harmless. Many organizations (companies, individuals, governments, etc) will collect data about their users' activity. Usually the user is unaware, and has no reasonable way to prevent this. 
		
				Even analytics, a seemingly innocent purpose, can collect enough data to cause concern. 
		
				Thus, I have removed Google Analytics from my website.
