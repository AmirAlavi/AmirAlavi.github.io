## Bio
Hi there, I'm Amir Alavi! I am currently a Ph.D. student in **Computational Biology**, and a Master's student in **Machine Learning**, at the **School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University**. My advisor is [Dr. Ziv Bar-Joseph](http://sb.cs.cmu.edu/), and my research areas span machine learning and genomics.

My primary research interest is to develop machine learning methods for representation learning of transcriptomics data. My work has encompased dimensionality reduction, batch effect correction, classification, and marker characterization for scRNA-seq data.

## Privacy
Often times, the collection of data across the web is done without thought, and believed to be harmless. Many organizations (companies, individuals, governments, etc) will collect data about their users' activity. Usually the user is unaware, and has no reasonable way to prevent this.

Even analytics, a seemingly innocent purpose, can collect enough data to cause concern.

In light of the above, I have removed Google Analytics from my website.
