## Personal
I'm originally from Michigan (Go Blue!). I'm an outdoor activity enthusiast, and have become a thrill seeker since moving to CA. You might see me riding around SF on my bike, nicknamed [Hasufel](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Hasufel). If it can be pedaled, shredded, or ripped, I'll try it &#129305;.

## Professional Bio
A computer scientist by training, I moved into applied work for grad school. I was a Ph.D. student in **Computational Biology**, and a Master's student in **Machine Learning**, at the **School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University**. My advisor was [Dr. Ziv Bar-Joseph](http://sb.cs.cmu.edu/), and my research areas spanned machine learning and genomics.

My primary research interest was to develop machine learning methods for representation learning of **transcriptomics** data. My work encompassed dimensionality reduction, batch effect correction, classification, and marker characterization for scRNA-seq data.

Now in industry, I've changed domains from transcriptomics to **proteomics**.
