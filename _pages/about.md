## Bio
I'm currently a Ph.D. student in **Computational Biology**, and a Master's student in **Machine Learning**, at the **School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University**. My advisor is [Dr. Ziv Bar-Joseph](http://sb.cs.cmu.edu/), and my research areas span machine learning and genomics.

My primary research interest is to develop machine learning methods for representation learning of transcriptomics data. My work encompasses dimensionality reduction, batch effect correction, classification, and marker characterization for scRNA-seq data.
